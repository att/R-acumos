0.3-0
    o	add `composeFromSource()` and `pushFromSource()` functions, enabling 
    respectively to compose and to push a bundle from an R file (considered 
    as the component source) in which all the functions and auxiliary 
    objects needed to compose the bundle are defined.

    o	change `push()` to look up and include in the POST request a potential 
    `component.R` file contained in the bundle.

0.2-8
    o	add `create`, `license` and `headers` parameters to `push()`.

    o	change the meaning of `...` in `push()` to supply any additional
	elements for body of the `POST` request. This allows optional
	parameters to be added to the onboarding service.


0.2-7
    o	allow the `file' argument in run() to be a directory
	containing the unpacked component.


0.2-6
    o	added send.msg(..., response=TRUE) to allow more easy testing
	of REST-style pushes (internal interface only).

    o	minor documentation updates such as mention of data_response
	run-time option.


0.2-5
    o	updated to generate meta.json version 0.5.0

    o	added service rpc entry in the proto file


0.2-4
    o	update push() to take the bundle and upload in pieces until
	the server supports bundles.

    o	include schema version in meta.json


0.2-3
    o	improve package dependency detection by removing versions and
	whitespaces


0.2-2
    o	add run(init.only=TRUE) option to setup the run-time
	environment without actually running the server

    o	new runtime parameter data_response=TRUE enables direct
	passing of the output data to the caller. When set the POST
	request to the functions (like /predict) returns the result in
	the same request. If nto set (the default) it only retuns
	success/failure status.    

0.2-1
    o	add auth() function to obtain authentication token from Acumos.

    o	add push(token=) to use token (obtained form auth()) for
	authentication purposes.

	individual files (.json/.bin/.proto)

    o	addd debugging env var ACUMOS_DEBUG for verbose logging
